## Architecture — the part worth stealing

Two stages, splitting TabPFN v2's alternating bi-attention:

1. **Tabular embedding module**, producing fixed-dimension row embeddings:
   - **Distribution-aware column-wise embedding** — reformulated as a **set-input** problem. A
     permutation-invariant set of cell values in, one-to-one embeddings out, via a **Set
     Transformer** with induced self-attention. Motivation: features have wildly different
     distributions, and conventional feature-specific embedding modules without parameter
     sharing limit cross-table transferability. The set formulation recovers distribution
     metadata per column while remaining transferable.
   - **Context-aware row-wise interaction** — models dependencies between features within a row.
2. **ICL module** — a transformer over the tokenized train+test row embeddings. Labels are used
   **only** here.

Because rows are compressed to fixed dimension in stage 1, stage 2 is not quadratic in features.
That is the whole scaling trick.

## Results

- Pretrained on synthetic datasets up to **60K samples**; handles **500K** samples on affordable
  resources.
- Across **200 TALENT** classification datasets: on par with TabPFN v2, systematically **faster**
  — **1.5×** on small datasets, **3–10×** on large.
- On **53 datasets with >10K samples**, beats both TabPFN v2 and **CatBoost**.
- Fitted runtime scaling laws give ~**5× average speedup** on large datasets.
- Concrete: 10,000 samples × 100 features → ~20 s vs 1 min 40 s for TabPFN v2.
- Achieved by "using fewer of the expensive row-wise and column-wise attention layers with
  smaller embedding dimension before ICL on tokenized rows."

## Prior-design detail

The synthetic prior **oversamples the identity/random function**: the random activation is sampled
**ten times more often** than other activations, "to account for the fact that it can represent
many different functions." Tree depth `r = ceil(log10 k)` for `k` classes, since each split
reduces class count by ≥10×.

## Why it matters here

- **The column-then-row factorization is the structural answer** to the quadratic blow-up that
  forces nanoTabPFN's speedrun to start with an SDPA rewrite. It is a bigger structural lever
  than anything in the speedrun ledger, and it composes with them.
- **That prior-sampling detail is a concrete, cheap lever** nobody in the ledger has tried —
  prior *design* is a separate axis from optimizer and precision, and the speedrun protocol
  only constrains the evaluation pipeline, not the prior. Changing the prior is fair game.
- Beats CatBoost on >10K-sample classification, which is the closest published support for the
  observation that TFMs beat GBDT once data is not scarce.

## Caveats

- **Classification only.** No regression objective, and nothing on two-part / zero-heavy
  targets — this paper neither establishes nor refutes anything about decomposition approaches.
- Ties to the prior dump: nanoTabPFN's prior was generated with TabICL's prior implementation
  (per its paper), so the two are already coupled at the data level.
- Later TabICLv2 (arXiv 2602.11139) is a separate, much larger effort — 24.5 H100-days. This
  digest covers v1.
